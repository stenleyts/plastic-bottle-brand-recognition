# Plastic Bottle Brand Recognition System

A computer vision project that recognizes plastic bottle brands using CNN for real-time detection.

## Overview
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify and detect different brands of plastic bottles from mixed image datasets.

## Features
- Image classification using CNN
- Real-time detection through webcam feed
- Dataset from Kaggle, Google Images, and self-collected samples
